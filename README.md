# About the Project-
 This project analyzes credit card usage and financial metrics for a banking institution using Power BI and DAX functions. The goal is to calculate key financial indicators such as running totals, moving averages, growth rates, and credit risk scores, providing insights to improve customer retention and financial performance.
# Problem Statement
As a Financial Data Analyst, my objective is to analyze credit card transactions and financial behavior using DAX calculations in Power BI. Key analysis areas include:

  Tracking spending habits and credit utilization trends.
  Identifying high-risk customers based on revolving balance and delinquency rate.
  Assessing customer satisfaction scores and churn indicators.
  Understanding the correlation between income and credit limits.
  Analyzing loan approval trends based on credit limits.

 # Dataset Overview
This project utilizes two key datasets:

1.Credit Card Data (Credit limit, Total revolving balance, Utilization ratio, Interest earned)
2.Customer Data (Loan status, Job type, Income, Satisfaction score)
3.Key objectives include risk assessment, consumer behavior analysis, and financial stability insights
